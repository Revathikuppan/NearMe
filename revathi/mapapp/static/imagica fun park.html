    As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a widely recognized "Fun World"
     that is specifically associated with Thiruvannamalai. However, the term "Fun World"
      is relatively generic and could be used by different amusement parks, entertainment centers, 
      or businesses.

If you're looking for a specific Fun World in a particular location, it would be helpful to
 provide more details such as the city or region you're referring to. 
 There are several amusement parks and entertainment centers with similar names in
  different parts of the world.

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information, consider checking local directories, 
tourism websites, or contacting local authorities or tourism offices in the specific location 
you're interested in. Additionally, online search engines and travel forums may have information
 on any Fun World attractions in your desired area.
