    Arunachala Hill is a sacred mountain in the town of Thiruvannamalai in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. 
    It is known as the Annamalai Hill and is associated with the Annamalaiyar Temple,
     which is dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. The temple and the hill are considered 
     highly sacred in Hinduism, and the hill is often referred to as Arunachala.

    Here are some key points about Arunachala Hill:
    
    Religious Significance: Arunachala is considered a manifestation of the Hindu god Shiva and 
    is revered as one of the Panchabhoota Sthalas, representing the element of fire. 
    The Annamalaiyar Temple, located at the base of the hill, is one of the largest and 
    most important Shiva temples in Southern India.
    
    Arunachala Purana: The Arunachala Purana, a religious text, extols the greatness of Arunachala 
    and narrates various legends associated with the hill. It is believed that 
    circumambulating the hill (a practice known as Girivalam) is spiritually significant.
    
    Girivalam (Circumambulation): Devotees often undertake a ritualistic walk 
    around the base of Arunachala Hill, covering a distance of about 14 kilometers. 
    This practice, known as Girivalam, is considered auspicious, and many pilgrims undertake 
    it during full moon days.
    
    Ramana Maharshi: The 20th-century sage Ramana Maharshi spent a significant part of his life 
    in the town of Thiruvannamalai, residing near Arunachala. He considered Arunachala to be a
     spiritual force and recommended the practice of self-inquiry, asking the question "Who am I?" 
     to seekers.
    
    Arunachala in Literature: Arunachala has been praised in various literary works, 
    including poems by the famous Tamil saint-poet Manickavacakar. 
    The hill has inspired numerous poets and seekers throughout history.
    
    Arunachala Deepam: The Karthigai Deepam festival, celebrated during the Tamil month 
    of Karthigai (November-December), is one of the most significant festivals 
    associated with Arunachala. A massive lamp is lit on the hill during this festival,
     and it is visible for miles around.
    
    Arunachala is not just a geographical feature but is deeply embedded in the spiritual and 
    cultural fabric of the region, attracting pilgrims and seekers from various parts of the country.
