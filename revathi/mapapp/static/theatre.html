    As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Anbu Cinemas is a well-known cinema chain in India.
     Anbu cinemas, which stands for Priya Village Roadshow, is one of the largest and 
     most popular cinema exhibition companies in the country. 
     It operates a network of multiplex theaters in various cities.

Anbu Cinemas typically offers a range of movie-viewing experiences, 
including standard screens, IMAX, 4DX, Gold Class, and more. They often provide online booking services, 
allowing customers to choose their seats and purchase tickets in advance.

For the most up-to-date information on Anbu Cinemas locations, showtimes, and offerings, 
I recommend checking the official Anbu Cinemas website or using their official mobile app.
 Additionally, you can check local directories or online movie ticketing platforms for 
 information on Anbu Cinemas in specific locations.

Please note that details about cinema chains and their locations can change over time
, so it's a good idea to verify the information from official sources or contact the cinema 
directly for the latest updates.
