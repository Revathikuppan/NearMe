    As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Thalappakatti is a popular
     South Indian restaurant chain known for its biryani. 
     The Dindigul Thalappakatti Biriyani restaurant, often simply called Thalappakatti, 
     originated in Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, and has expanded to various locations in India 
     and even internationally.

Key points about Thalappakatti:

Specialty: Thalappakatti is particularly famous for its Dindigul Thalappakatti Biriyani, 
a flavorful and aromatic biryani that has gained popularity among biryani enthusiasts.

Expansion: The brand has expanded its presence, and you can find Thalappakatti restaurants
 in various cities across India.

Menu: While biryani is a highlight, Thalappakatti restaurants typically offer a variety 
of South Indian dishes, including other rice preparations, vegetarian and non-vegetarian options,
 and traditional desserts.

Legacy: The brand has a long history, dating back to the 1950s, and is known for maintaining
 the authenticity and taste of its biryani recipe.

For the most current information, including the existence of any hotels associated with
 Thalappakatti or specific details about a location in Thiruvannamalai, 
 I recommend checking the official Thalappakatti website, contacting the restaurant directly, 
 or using local directories and review platforms. Additionally, local residents or tourism 
 information centers in Thiruvannamalai may provide relevant information.
